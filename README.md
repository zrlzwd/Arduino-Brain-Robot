# Section 1: Hardware
**Arduino board (Arduino UNO ATMEGA328P R3 € 26.98**)   
- A small programmable computer which acts as the head of the robot, allowing us to control its behaviours.

**Distance sensor (HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor € 4.49**)
- A sensor which measures the distance from the nearest objects by sending and recieving waves. This sensor allows us to program the robot to take appropriate action if there is an obstacle within the range.

**AWG Jumper Wires (HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor € 4.95**)
- Wires are used to connect different components together.

**Bluetooth to serial slave**
- Small device which can be pluged into the robot and be programmed to controll the robot remotely e.g. using an android app.

**Battery holder (€ 1.29**)
- Robots, like humans need energy in order to operate, they consume their energy from batteries. Battery box allow as to connect the batteries to the device.

**Prototyping board (€ 5.95**)
- Prototyping board plays an unique part in planning stage.

**Motor controller (Arduino Motor Shield R3 € 44.00**)
- Controller which allows us to control the motors of the vehicle kit, neceserry in order to program/controll the speed and turnings of the robot.

**Vehicle kit (Magician Chassis € 44.00**)
- The base for the robot, which includes motors and wheels, supports the rest of hardware, compiled together forms a fully operational robot.

# Section 2: Assembly

**Components**
- These are the components of the vehicle kit : the plastic chassis, wheels, motors, battery box and screws. It also comes with a manual and we followed that step-by-step in order to build this vehicle.

**Bottom Chassis**
- First we worked on assembling the bottom part of the vehicle which are the wheels, omni wheel and the motors. To setup the wheels we first connected the speed holder with wheel rotator of the motors and then attached it on the bottom chassis using the little plastice studs. After the motors are attached, we then push the wheels onto the speed holder. Next we mounted the omni wheel at the front (use the end 2 of the 4 holes in a line).

**Top Chassis**
- Then we assembled the top part by connecting the top chassis with spacers and screws to the bottom chassis. Use the two holes at the corner in the straight end of the bottom chassis and then use the very last two T-shaped holes in the curved end of the bottom chassis.

**Mounting hardwares onto the vehicle**
- We then mounted the other hardwares into the vehicles such as the arduino board, motor shield, breadboard, distance sensor and bluetooth sensor. The manufacturer suggests attaching the battery box to the bottom chassis, but to avoid the hassle of unscrewing the top to change the batteries, we have attached the box to the top platform. We just mounted the motor shield on the arduino board and connected all the wires to the motor shield. If you have a different motor shield, the wires should be connected to the arduino board.

**Connecting wires**
- The last step is connecting all the wires from the arduino or motor shield to the breadboard and the motors and then putting on the battery. The robot is now set for programming.
